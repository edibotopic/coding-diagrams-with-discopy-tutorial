# DisCoPy as a general, programmatic diagramming tool

DisCoPy is a Python toolkit for generating diagrams with code.

This repo consists of a single `.ipynb` file with text and code showing simple
examples of how DisCoPy can be used.

You can view the `.ipynb` file directly in GitHub.

To play with the examples yourself `git clone` the repo, `cd` to the directory 
and install DisCoPy with:

```bash
cd coding-diagrams-with-discopy-tutorial
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I recommend installing in a virtual environment and using VSCode, which has
excellent support for `.ipynb` files.

You can also run an interactive version of the notebook online using Binder.
Warning: it can take a few minutes before an editable version is rendered.
